# User Guide: Working with Joe
Welcome to my user guide. I appreciate your time to learn more about me. I’m looking to establish and build a meaningful relationship (beyond surface level), build trust, and accomplish more together. The relationship between you and I will make the biggest impact on your engagement, retention, and development. Therefore, as we learn and grow together, I can make a huge difference. 

Writing the user guide provided me with the space to reflect and become more self-aware. I highly encourage you to write your own user guide. Not only will you learn more about yourself, but the team will also get to know you and work with you better.

This guide is a living document and the content will change over time as I continue to grow as a person and learn how we can best support each other. 

### Leadership Inspiration and Philosophy - Start with Why
I was inspired to become a leader when I discovered Simon Sinek’s work. He’s written several books on leadership and business. He’s well known for his TED Talk, [Start with Why - How Great Leaders Inspire Action](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en) which led to his first book, Start with Why. I recommend reading his entire library. 

Most recently, I read [The Infinite Game](https://simonsinek.com/the-infinite-game). The book inspired me to adopt an infinite mindset. In an infinite game, there is no end. It’s not about winning or losing like baseball (a finite game). It’s about understanding that you’ll be ahead and behind at various stages. With a finite mindset, you focus and “win” in the short term. There can be many finite games within the infinite game. However, if you only focus on the short-term, you’ll lose sight of the future and long-term growth potential. With an infinite mindset, you think about your competitors as rivals and learn from them, stay aligned to your purpose, and avoid becoming a commodity. The goal is to stay adaptable in a changing environment, perpetuate your business, outlast your rivals, and lead people into the future.

### People are Human Beings, not Resources
What is a company? People serving people serving people. I’m very passionate about treating people as people. A diverse, inclusive, inspired, innovative, and performing team does not exist without people. People have ideas, emotions, beliefs, and hearts. People get things done. Creating a diverse, inclusive, and safe experience, it’s about encouraging and supporting people to bring their whole selves to work. You may have heard, “People are a company’s most important asset.” I believe people and their relationships are more important than just people to perpetuate long-term growth. I also don’t like the word asset as it can imply people are owned and managed like resources. Leadership expert, Tom Peters sums it up and shares his raw emotion about the topic in this [short 3-minute video](https://vimeo.com/347311842). I will not call you a resource. I respect you as a human being. I will use the word resource when referring to things like a book, software, a link to a Google Doc, and cool Shure audio equipment.

### Communication
Communication is critical for building our trusting relationship. 
I give trust, however, I recognize that I must earn yours. 
I prefer to talk face to face when possible given the appropriate context (video call when working remotely or in-office ), and understanding the situation with COVID and our distributed remote locations. I believe talking face to face provides a better opportunity to foster a meaningful relationship beyond surface level. You cannot see the delivery of words via text, Slack, or email. I learn more about you by observing your facial expressions, tone, and body language. 

However, I understand that not all communication can be face-to-face. 
There are moments when other forms of communication are more appropriate. Forms of communication; Call, Text, Slack, JIRA, and Email. 

For examples of communication, we can discuss what works best and hold each other accountable:
- Utilize text and/or Slack if you are dealing with a family emergency, sick, “running late” to work, late to a meeting, or lunch takes longer than expected. I will reply to your message with a confirmation and share the message with the team.
- Utilize Slack for quick Q/A, team communication, announcements, and sharing knowledge.
- Utilize JIRA to communicate ticket updates, and strategy, creating alignment among agile team members and product owners.

If I’m on vacation and there’s an urgent matter and you cannot connect with the escalation team, please text me. An urgent matter would include a major system failure. 

My time with you is extremely important. If you have an idea or issue and would like to discuss it,  please set up a time on my calendar or create a topic item for our next 1:1. If an issue needs to be addressed in ‘real-time’ please send a direct Slack DM. I will make myself available for your needs.

I don’t expect you to respond to everything in ‘real-time’. 
In fact, if you are in deep thought experiencing flow, or need a specific time frame to focus, please make me aware and I won’t bother you. Lastly, please be cognizant of what you write in Slack or company communication tools as the content can be subpoenaed.

### 1:1s
The 1:1 time provides us with an opportunity to develop a positive and trusting relationship. I would like to address your topics and needs first, encouraging you to take responsibility for setting the agenda. I’m accountable for ensuring your needs are met and sharing topics as well. Please keep task updates for our Scrum ceremonies, Slack, and JIRA. We can discuss task updates anytime during the week. The goal of the 1:1 is to make them meaningful and valuable by focusing on your growth and needs.

People like spending time in 1:1 conversations about: 
- Goal Setting 
- Goal Review 
- Performance feedback 
- Problem-solving 
- Soliciting specific support 

In our first 1:1, I will ask you what you need and want. I like to start with the following questions.
- How often would you like to meet with me one-on-one?  
- How long would you like those meetings to last? 
- How should we set the agenda? 
- What topics of conversation are most important and urgent for you? 
- What topics of conversation are highly important but less urgent and how do we make sure we get to these topics at the right frequency? 

We will keep track of our topics in a Google Doc and recap items discussed with any actions. The doc will help us make updates and share thoughts in real-time to prepare and reference prior topics. The doc can be accessed in the meeting invitation or in Slack (pinned in our conversation thread). Lastly, I will pause my Slack notifications and any other technology to provide you with my full attention. Please try to eliminate distractions on your end.

### Feedback from me to you 
My goal is to provide you with real-time candid feedback. I believe real-time feedback makes a  greater impact than waiting later, or for the “right time”. 
Providing you with candid feedback will help you grow and build a trusting relationship. It will enable you to feel more comfortable giving me feedback. 

I like Kim Scott’s radical candor framework. Radical candor is about caring personally and challenging directly. Kim provides [great learning material on her site](https://www.radicalcandor.com/).

Beyond radical candor, I’m researching ideas and viewpoints on feedback. Most recently, I listened to a Management 3.0 podcast episode, [Why Feedback is the Most Toxic Barrier to Human Growth](https://management30.com/podcast/why-feedback-is-the-most-toxic-barrier-to-human-growth/). The episode made me think hard about my approach to feedback. Carol Sanford believes feedback is the most toxic practice to human growth and to democracy and education. She explains why we need to look inwards in order to grow instead of basing feedback on what others say. “People wake up and come alive when they’re in charge of their own growth and behaviour change.” I’m in the process of digesting the content and looking to see what it could look like to take the best from each framework.

### Feedback from you to me
I expect you to reciprocate and provide me with radical candor. I’m learning to be a better leader every day. I will improve my self-awareness and leadership if you are open and honest about my performance. Your candor will make me a better person and in return make your life a lot better.

### Building Relationships with Others and Business Knowledge
Building a strong relationship and meeting your needs is my top priority. Additionally, building relationships with others is critical as you have an opportunity to build rapport and trust with the team. Our team lives in different regions of the country. A small majority of us may only be able to connect in person. I provide recommendations below that can apply to any context. Please consider the [COVID Workplace Guide](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/workplaces-businesses/index.html) when meeting in person at the office.
- Meet and collaborate with people beyond our team - become curious about what other people are doing. Take the initiative to set up a zoom meeting. Setting up a virtual coffee may be a good first step
- Ask people to lunch, coffee, dinner, etc..
- Ask lots of questions and listen intently

Moreover, learn as much as you can about the company. Figure out what you need to learn, whom to learn it from, and how to speed up your learning process. Understand the history of the organization, ask “How did we get to this point?” Learn about the company’s roles, responsibilities, and how decisions are made. Talk to people with different points of view. It will deepen your insight. Building strong relationships and business knowledge will accelerate your learning and onboarding.

### Tracking Progress
We utilize our Scrum Ceremonies and JIRA for tracking work progress. I should be able to understand your progress by reviewing the sprint board. Please report any blockers, issues, or impediments that may occur during your task so I’m aware and offer appropriate facilitation.  
In addition, let me know when we are exceeding our sprint goals. I will circle back with the product owners to confirm the next highest priority and make it ready for the sprint. 

Examples:  
- Blocker - additional time needed with a product owner to align on requirements.
- Testing - a feature needs additional testing, please connect with the QE team.
- Sprint Goals - share progress towards a goal and identify any blockers or new learnings.

### On micromanagement 
I do not prefer the word manager. I’m not here to control and tell you what to do. Furthermore, I do not micromanage. I start with trust, provide context, and extend autonomy. People aren’t motivated by being told what to do and how to solve problems. Daniel Pink shares a [study about what truly motivates people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SfmmuC9IWs). Common to the agile world, you may already be aware of his research on autonomy, mastery, and purpose. My focus is on creating a safe and inclusive environment to inspire and motivate experimentation leading to innovative solutions.

### Me as a Coach to You
I can help you connect with the right people based on your needs.  
In addition, I can provide you with leadership guidance. 
Please talk to me about any situation that can be impacting your focus or dealing with people. 
If there is a people problem, I expect you to address the issue directly with that person first. However, I can provide you with guidance on how to deal with the problem prior to addressing the  issue.

### Leading Others
My goal is to inspire everyone to be a leader. Leadership isn’t about titles, corner offices, direct reports, and fancy shoes. It’s about serving others. I will lead by example, and provide guidance and  training. You can make a positive impact on others. 

### Learning and Development 
I’m passionate about learning and consider myself an infinite learner (lifelong). I embrace it to live a fulfilling life. Learning includes all aspects of life, think of your whole self.

I’m inspired by futurist [John Hagel](https://www.johnhagel.com/) and his thoughts captured below on learning from this [Future of Work podcast episode](https://thefutureorganization.com/everyone-needs-know-future-work/)... 
“Increasingly now in a world that’s shaped by these technologies and where the half-life of a skill is  getting shorter and shorter, as individuals we need to start with the awareness that whatever we know  today is becoming obsolete at an accelerating rate. So we have to learn faster. And we can’t just sit back on the credentials we had or the experience we’ve had in the past, but we need to be constantly  looking for new opportunities to get better faster at whatever area that we are most interested in.”

What can we do to learn faster and focus on the things that matter most to our development? I’ve applied the concept of learning agility. Learning agility enables you to focus on the things that you’re most passionate about (people tend to learn faster), and creates agility to handle changing environments/trends. Think of a company that is continuously learning. As a whole, the company becomes more agile and can adapt to the environment faster. Learning agility makes innovation possible and perpetuates a company’s growth.

### Contribution to Strategy
You have unique perspectives, expertise, and ideas. I encourage you to be a rainmaker. Look for opportunities beyond your role or function that can impact the business. I recommend listening to the following Coaching for Leaders podcast episode to learn more about [moving from caretaker to rainmaker](https://coachingforleaders.com/podcast/390/). 

### Logistics
I keep my Google calendar current and expect the same from you.  
Please update your calendar to reflect vacation, meetings, training/conferences, or events. Please notify me as early as possible for extended time off, i.e. vacation.

I do not expect you to work on your vacation, work extra hours, or work on weekends. I prefer that you recharge. The goal is people sustainability and not burnout. We need to sustain a pace for the long term (infinite game). However, I understand if there is a special circumstance like a system outage. I will support you. 

I will not send you emails about work or tasks on the weekend and will not respond to your emails until Monday.  If there is an emergency, please send me a text message. 

Lastly, please be punctual to meetings. Respect everyone’s time.

## Extras: Advice and questions I use as good reminders and self-reflection
### Advice
- Respect people. It doesn’t matter what their job title is, family name, beliefs, and perspectives. Be curious and ask questions. Look to understand their story. If meeting someone for the first time, don’t start with, “What do you do?” By asking this question, we assume a person’s life is defined by their career. There’s more to a person. Ask them, “What’s your story?”, listen carefully and ask more questions.
- Make [celebration](https://hbr.org/2022/01/celebrate-to-win) a part of your routine. Celebration is an important opportunity to cement the lessons learned on the path to achievement and to strengthen the relationships between people that make future achievement more plausible. 
- Be better every day.
- It’s ok if you don’t know something, speak up and ask for help.

### Questions
“How might I show up with my best energy at work so I can be more impactful?”

“What might I simplify so this is easier for others to understand?”

“How might I focus on what’s moving the needle to more effectively drive the outcomes we desire?”

“What is it going to take to succeed?”

“What is the impact and how are we going to measure it?”

Premortem questions (these questions help identify potential risks upfront vs in a postmortem):
- “How is this project going to fail?”
- “What are the risks involved that can lead to this project failing?"
- “How can we mitigate the risk?”
- “What are we going to need to be successful?"
- “How might I be wrong?”
