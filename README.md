# User Guide: Working with Joe
Welcome to my user guide. I appreciate your time to learn more about me. I’m looking to establish and build a meaningful relationship (beyond surface level), build trust, and accomplish more together. The relationship between you and I will make the biggest impact on your engagement, retention, and development. Therefore, as we learn and grow together, I can make a huge difference. 

Writing the user guide provided me with the space to reflect and become more self-aware. I highly encourage you to write your own user guide. Not only will you learn more about yourself, but the team will also get to know you and work with you better.

This guide is a living document and the content will change over time as I continue to grow as a person and learn how we can best support each other. 

### Leadership Inspiration and Philosophy - Start with Why
I was inspired to become a leader when I discovered Simon Sinek’s work. He’s written several books on leadership and business. He’s well known for his TED Talk, [Start with Why - How Great Leaders Inspire Action] (https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en) which led to his first book, Start with Why. I recommend reading his entire library.
