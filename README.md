# User Guide: Working with Joe
Welcome to my user guide. I appreciate your time to learn more about me. Iâ€™m looking to establish and build a meaningful relationship (beyond surface level), build trust, and accomplish more together. The relationship between you and I will make the biggest impact on your engagement, retention, and development. Therefore, as we learn and grow together, I can make a huge difference.
